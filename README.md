Hello! This README provides an overview and description of each component, interactive features, and some insights. 
**This project is currently unavailable**. I am updating this analysis as more news of the economic impacts of Trump's re-election as POTUS comes to light. I will post it again soon!

# Projected Impact of Trump’s Tariff Plan on the Technology Sector in Asia

Welcome! This Tableau dashboard analyzes the potential impact of Trump’s 2025 proposed tariff plan on the technology trade sector across major Asian countries. Here, we explore historical trends (2020-2023) and projected values for 2025, providing a comprehensive view of trade shifts resulting from the potential tariff policies.

The data I used in this dashboard was obtained from the **U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC)** DataWeb, which provides detailed trade statistics and tariff information. Specifically, I accessed import data related to the technology sector across major Asian countries, focusing on key metrics such as Calculated Duties, CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight), Import Value, and Customs Value.

The following are the HTS codes used: 8541, 8542, 8534, 8543, 8471, 8473, 8470, 8517, 8525, 8526, 8528, 8504, 8527, 9013, 8529, 8472, 8479, 8523, 8507, 8509, 9031

I gathered historical data from 2020 to 2023 to analyze trade patterns and built projections for 2024 based on the hypothetical impacts of the proposed tariff policy. This combination of historical data and projected values allows for a comparative analysis of trade changes.

## Dashboard Summary

### Projected Technology Trade Values for 2025
   - The choropleth map visualizes the estimated trade values for 2025 across selected Asian countries, highlighting potential increases or declines due to tariff changes.
   - Countries are colour-coded based on projected trade volume, with darker shades indicating higher values.

### Historical Technology Trade Values (2020-2023)
   - The line chart displays historical technology trade values for each year, showing trends in trade volume across China, India, Japan, and other key countries.
   - This section helps compare past trade performance and contextualize projected 2025 figures.

### Percent Change in Technology Trade (2023-2024)
   - The bar chart shows the percentage change in trade values from 2023 to 2024, allowing users to identify the countries most affected by the tariff plan.
   - Positive and negative impacts are represented, highlighting countries that may experience significant growth or decline.

## Interactive Features

- **Country Filter and Hover Actions**: Hovering and selecting any country in the legend or charts highlights the corresponding data across all dashboard components, making it easy to focus on specific countries.
- **Metric Filtering**: You can toggle between different trade metrics, including calculated duties, CIF import values, and customs values, to refine the map data view.

## What I learned *so far*

The data suggests China will experience the most significant reduction in trade value due to high tariffs. At the same time, India shows a unique projected increase, possibly benefiting from shifts in supply chains. Other countries like Japan and South Korea face moderate declines, reflecting their exposure to U.S. tariffs. Meanwhile, semiconductors, integrated circuits, and telecommunications equipment are hit hardest, affecting key exports from China and South Korea. Consumer electronics also faces some declines.

**Tariff Costs Analysis**: Higher Calculated Duties and Customs Values indicate increased costs, reducing trade volumes, and the CIF Import Value highlights how tariffs amplify landed costs, pressuring importers and potentially reshaping supply chains.

### Conclusion
This analysis suggests that the proposed tariffs could lead to substantial trade disruptions in Asia’s tech sector, particularly for countries heavily reliant on the U.S. market. These shifts may alter global supply chains, with India potentially emerging as a beneficiary.
